The answer is Chueca.\r\n\r\nA neighborhood in a constant evolution where we will stop time and we will dust off their stories, curiosities and meet great characters who have given their most personal stamp to one of the most cosmopolitan neighborhoods in the city. A neighborhood bathed by a mixture of tradition and modernism, by ghosts that have welcomed us in some streets for centuries, by mysteries hidden under the stones.\r\n\r\nBecause Chueca is much more, a neighborhood as enigmatic as open.

Without a doubt, walking next to some of its most symbolic places is the best way to understand where, how and why that cultural phenomenon of the 80s, known as La Movida Madrile\u00f1a, arose. The young people of that time faced an uncertain future living frantically in the present between transgression, the Uncovering and the Movida. Our meeting point will be the Plaza de la Luna, next to the door of the San Martin de Tours Church, from there we will stroll towards the Malasa\u00f1a neighborhood, still an icon of the Movida Madrile\u00f1a and the urban tribes of the time. Today we can still find some places that were the musical temples of the moment, such as the Sala Maravilla, El Penta or El Tupperware. We will reach the heart of Malasa\u00f1a, the Plaza del Dos de Mayo, but first we will show you some small Madrid wonders, such as the church of San Antonio de los Alemanes with its baroque architecture, the Teatro Lara and, going up Calle del Pez, the Bishop Theater. Did you know that it was founded in 1948 as a morning cinema? It was known as the Pez cinema. We will continue our tour towards the Plaza de Chueca. On our walk we will enjoy and learn about the buildings of interest that we will see, such as the Madrid History Museum, the San Ildefonso Market, the San Ant\u00f3n church or the Recogidas convent. If Malasa\u00f1a was the epicenter of the Movida, Chueca is the epicenter of the LGTB movement. This neighborhood has become one of the most visited areas of Madrid with an enormous activity between shops, bars and cultural offer. Its square is always full of neighbors and tourists who like to enjoy its terraces. Without a doubt, Chueca is the fashionable neighborhood. We will finish our route contemplating the House of the Seven Chimneys that contains an old legend from the 16th century. Do you want us to tell you?
